Sentiment Analysis with Python

After every survey we receive feedback from user in form of surveys and some plain text, Our actual CSAT score was good, but their comments were being tagged as mixed sentiment. Digging into this discrepancy revealed that users were not happy with the support they received from agents.
I have built several model which can be used to predict sentiments and to find which classifier or model can be built with less effort and high accuracy.
